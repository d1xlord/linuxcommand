#Generating SSH keys

#Link: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

#SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. The steps below will 
#walk you through generating an SSH key and adding the public key to your GitHub account.

#Step 1:Check for SSH keys

#First, we need to check for existing SSH keys on your computer. Open Terminal and enter:
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

	$ ls -al ~/.ssh

#Step 2:Generate a new SSH key

# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
# Generating public/private rsa key pair.

	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

#We strongly suggest keeping the default settings as they are, so when you're prompted to 
#"Enter a file in which to save the key", just press Enter to continue.

#Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

#You'll be asked to enter a passphrase.

$ Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
$ Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

#After you enter a passphrase, you'll be given the fingerprint, or id, of your SSH key. It will look something like this:
	Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
	# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	# The key fingerprint is:
	# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com

#Step 3:Add your key to the ssh-agent

#Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:
	# start the ssh-agent in the background	
	$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	# Agent pid 59566

#Add your generated SSH key to the ssh-agent:
	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

#Step 4: Password less login and Github ssh add example:

	#Pasword less login
	# Copy the ssh keys to remote host
		#Scp method
		$ scp - ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@hostName:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		# Another Easy method
		$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@hostName
		
	# Now login

	#Github ssh add
	#Just copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into ssh add github server
